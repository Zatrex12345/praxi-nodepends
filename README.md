# Read
Please note, I am not in any way responsible for anything you do while using this, I have only released this because I am not going to be using it as I am coding my own practice core from scratch.

I am not held responsible for anything that you do while using this source code, I have simply released this as I no longer use it

# What exactly have I changed?
Basic praxi would depend on both Zoot core & SpigotX, But in this version of praxi I have removed the dependencies to make this source code more usable and easier to fork.

# Enjoy. (Skidded by Vifez)
